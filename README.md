## Nerual Network Model
  - I used two hidden layers for my Neural Network model. There are 84 neurons in the first layer and 80 neurons in the second hidden layer.
  - The higest predictive accuracy score I acheived is 0.73.
  - To increase model performance, I tried the following steps:
    - I increased the number of hidden layers. I tries through 1 to 5 hidden layers and found 2 hidden layers works best. Other numbers either cause under-fitting or over-fitting.
    - I tried across activation functions and found sigmoid function works better.
